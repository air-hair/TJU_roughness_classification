# TJU_roughness_classification
Machine learning models used in the paper

This repository contains code used for classifying roughness in sensor data obtained from flexible sensors. The classification is performed using various machine learning models including CNN, RNN, LSTM, KNN, and SVM.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each model used in the classification task. Each model folder contains the following files:

- `config.py`: File for configuring parameters specific to the model.
- `loader.py`: Module for loading and preprocessing the sensor data.
- `model.py`: File defining the architecture and implementation of the model.
- `evaluator.py`: Module for evaluating the predictions and performance metrics.
- `main.py`: Main script for training the model and making predictions.

## Folder Structure

- `CNN/`: Contains files related to the Convolutional Neural Network model.
- `RNN/`: Contains files related to the Recurrent Neural Network model.
- `LSTM/`: Contains files related to the Long Short-Term Memory model.
- `KNN/`: Contains files related to the K-Nearest Neighbors model.
- `SVM/`: Contains files related to the Support Vector Machine model.

## Usage

To utilize this codebase, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the specific model folder (`CNN/`, `RNN/`, etc.).
2. Configure parameters in `config.py` if necessary.
3. Run `main.py` to train the model and make predictions.
